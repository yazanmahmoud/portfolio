      <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
      <p>I design and build digital experiences where clean interfaces meet intelligent systems. With 11+ years in web design and development, I’ve spent my career turning ideas into functional, user-focused products—and recently expanded that journey into AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science.</p>
      <p>From crafting responsive websites with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to analyzing AI-generated outputs using Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and PyTorch, I enjoy working at the intersection of design, data, and problem-solving. I’m especially drawn to understanding why things work (or don’t) and improving them through iteration and insight.</p>
      <p>Currently, I work as an AI Data Analyst, where I evaluate data quality, uncover patterns in AI behavior, and help shape more reliable and human-centered systems. I’ve collaborated in remote, Agile teams and thrive in environments that value clarity, experimentation, and thoughtful execution.</p>
      <p>I’m always curious, always building, and always looking for meaningful challenges that push products—and people—forward.</p>
