        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a web designer and AI-focused technologist with over 11 years of experience delivering user-centered digital solutions across diverse industries.
            My professional background combines long-term hands-on experience in web design and development with recent formal training and applied work in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science.
            This blend allows me to approach problems from both a design and analytical perspective, ensuring solutions are not only functional but also efficient, scalable, and user-focused.
        </p>

        <p>My technical expertise includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Python, along with data and machine learning tools such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and PyTorch.
            I have designed, built, and maintained websites end-to-end, optimized performance and usability, and collaborated closely with clients to translate requirements into reliable digital products. 
            In my current role as an AI Data Analyst, I evaluate AI-generated outputs, assess data quality, and analyze patterns that influence system performance and user experience, contributing to more accurate and dependable AI-driven solutions.
        </p>

        <p>I have worked effectively in remote and Agile environments, collaborating with cross-functional teams and maintaining clear, professional communication throughout all stages of development.
            My academic background, which includes an IT Programming for AI diploma and a foundation in computer science and psychology, further supports my ability to understand both technical systems and user behavior.
        </p>
        <p>I believe effective digital products are built at the intersection of clarity, reliability, and purpose. 
            Technology should not only function correctly, but also communicate clearly, respect the user, and scale responsibly. 
            Whether designing interfaces or evaluating AI-driven systems, I prioritize solutions that are transparent, maintainable, and grounded in real user needs.</p>
        
        <p>My approach is rooted in continuous learning and thoughtful iteration. I value evidence-based decision-making, careful analysis, and incremental improvement over quick fixes. 
            By combining design principles with data-driven insight, I aim to build systems that are both technically sound and practically useful.</p>
        
        <p>I also believe strong communication is essential to successful technology. 
            Clear documentation, honest feedback, and collaborative problem-solving enable teams to work efficiently and deliver better outcomes—especially in remote and multidisciplinary environments. 
            Above all, I strive to build technology that enhances human capability rather than complicates it.</p>    
        
        <h2>Career Mission</h2>

        <p>My career mission is to build and contribute to digital products that are intelligent, reliable, and human-centered. 
            I aim to continuously deepen my expertise in AI and data-driven systems while applying my long-standing experience in web design to create solutions that are clear, ethical, and impactful. 
            I am particularly motivated by roles and projects that encourage learning, ownership, and long-term growth, and where thoughtful technology can solve real-world problems at scale.</p>
